<p>A body in motion<br />
A room becomes sculptural.</p>

<p>A need to press ()<br />
Sisters, doubles, two phrases complete themselves and perform a speech act on a structure.</p>

<p>I'm on both sides<br />
A spatial device to see through and from. Slicing the walls</p>


<p>Lay me down in to a bed of marble.<br />
<i>Tripping hazard</i></p>

<p>A scene<br />
An edge of the wall, <br />
and a sink, leaky pipe, gut, or rain.</p>

<p>The chromosome, the table without its legs or top</p>

<p>An invisible parameter is defined. A room within a room, a line is a dot that takes a curvey walk.</p>
